# skellam 0.2.4

---

## New Features and Improvements
- Added a comprehensive `README.md` with usage examples, installation instructions, and badges (e.g., CRAN status, license).
- Improved the **vignette** (`validate_skellam.Rmd`) with clearer explanations, reproducible examples, and better visualizations.

## Documentation Updates
- Revised documentation for `skellam.reg` to clarify parameter definitions, return values, and included practical examples.

## Internal Changes
- Updated vignette-building dependencies (now requires `rmarkdown` and `knitr`).
- Minor fixes to ensure compatibility with `R CMD check` across all tested platforms (see `cran-results.md`).
